A starter DataOps repository with examples and tooling for building reproducible, testable, and observable data pipelines. This repository contains examples and scaffolding for ETL/ELT pipelines, orchestration, testing, and infrastructure-as-code.

> NOTE: This is an example README. Replace placeholder commands, services, and config with those used in your project.

## Overview

This repo provides an opinionated starting point for building data pipelines and DataOps workflows. It demonstrates:
- Local development with Docker / docker-compose
- Orchestration examples (Airflow / Prefect / Dagster — pick one)
- Transformation layer (dbt or plain SQL)
- Streaming / CDC examples (Kafka / Debezium)
- Infrastructure-as-code examples (Terraform)
- Automated tests and CI

## Goals

- Make it easy to prototype pipelines locally and on CI
- Encourage modular, testable transformation code
- Provide examples of observability and monitoring
- Document conventions for environments and deployment

## Architecture

Simple ETL/ELT flow (example):

Source Systems --> Ingest (Kafka / Batch extract) --> Staging (raw tables / files) --> Transform (dbt / SQL) --> Serving layer (data warehouse / analytical tables) --> Consumers (BI / ML)

Example ASCII diagram:

```
[ MySQL ] --> Debezium --> [ Kafka ] --> Ingest Service --> [ S3 / Raw ] --> dbt --> [ Snowflake / Postgres ]
                                          \
                                           --> Airflow Scheduled Jobs
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker & docker-compose (or Podman)
- Python 3.9+
- (Optional) Terraform, dbt, Kafka tools depending on which parts you use

### Quickstart (development)

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/dataops-bc.git
cd dataops-bc
```

2. Copy and edit environment files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set secrets and connection strings
```

3. Start local dependencies with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start services such as a Postgres metadata DB, Airflow webserver/scheduler, Kafka (if included), and a local data warehouse emulator.

4. Run migrations / setup:

```bash
# Example: initialize Airflow DB
docker-compose exec airflow-webserver airflow db init

# Example: run dbt models
docker-compose exec dbt dbt deps
docker-compose exec dbt dbt run
```

5. Open the UI:
- Airflow: http://localhost:8080
- Kafka UI / Kafdrop: http://localhost:9000
- Local Postgres: psql ... (credentials from .env)

## Project Layout

This is a suggested layout — adapt as needed.

- infra/            - Terraform / cloud infra examples
- orchestration/    - Airflow / Prefect / Dagster DAGs / flows
- ingestion/        - Kafka producers / consumers, connectors
- transforms/       - dbt project or SQL-based transforms
- tests/            - unit, integration, and data tests
- charts/           - Helm charts or k8s manifests (if any)
- scripts/          - helper scripts and utilities
- docs/             - additional documentation and runbooks

## Common Commands

- Build images:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

- Start services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- Stop services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

- Run a pipeline locally (example with Airflow):

```bash
# trigger a DAG run
docker-compose exec airflow-webserver airflow dags trigger example_dag
```

- Run dbt models:

```bash
docker-compose exec dbt dbt run --profiles-dir /path/to/profiles
```

- Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Configuration

Environment variables are kept in `.env`. Example keys (customize for your project):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@postgres:5432/mydb
AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@postgres:5432/airflow
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9092
DBT_PROFILES_DIR=/project/transforms
```

Never commit secrets. Use a secrets manager (Vault, AWS SSM, GitHub Secrets) for CI/CD.

## Testing

Recommended layers of tests:

- Unit tests for extraction/transformation code (pytest)
- Integration tests for DAG/task execution (may use Docker)
- Data tests (dbt tests, Great Expectations, or custom assertions)
- Contract tests for upstream/downstream interfaces

Example running tests:

```bash
pytest tests/unit
pytest tests/integration  # may require docker-compose services
```

## CI / CD

- Use the repository's CI (GitHub Actions) to:
  - Lint code (flake8, black)
  - Run unit tests
  - Run dbt tests
  - Build and publish Docker images
  - Deploy infra with Terraform (on protected branches)
- Protect main branch, require PR reviews and passing checks.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
3. Make changes, add tests
4. Open a PR describing your changes
5. Ensure CI passes and a reviewer approves

Follow the coding style and include small, focused PRs.

## Troubleshooting

- Airflow can't connect to the DB: check AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN and that the DB container is healthy.
- dbt profile errors: ensure DBT_PROFILES_DIR points to the mounted profile and credentials are correct.
- Kafka connectivity: verify advertised.listeners in Kafka config when running across hosts.
